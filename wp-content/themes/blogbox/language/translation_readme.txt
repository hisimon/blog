blogBox WordPress Theme - Translation Ready
==============================================

1) I believe the plug in is ready for translation.
2) I have included  blogBox.pot which you can load into Poedit to do your translation.
3) As part of setting up the theme for translation, I worked through a French Translation. Now I 
   know I'm from Canada and I should be bilingual, but I'm not. I use a Google Translator for the job. 
   The main purpose was to test the translation in the plugin. I imagine the French translation could 
   be greatly improved upon.
4) For anyone who goes through the trouble to translate the plugin to a different language, send me the 
   .po and .mo files and I will add them to the release.
